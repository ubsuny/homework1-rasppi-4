**Homework 1**

I ran the entirity of Homework 6 from last semester on my Raspberry Pi 4.

To do this, I:

* Put the 64bit OS my SD card.
* Also put a blank ssh file on the SD card.
* Wired ethernet and power to the raspberry pi 4.
* Used ssh pi@raspberrypi.local in a terminal.
* Git cloned the Rasp4 team github, homework 6 from last semester github, as well as the Comp Phys github.
* Downloaded Jupyter - including matlib plot and scripty.
* Downloaded python 3.
* Rebooted as needed.
* Opened up VNC viewer, changing the resolution such that the desktop displayed.
* Opened a jupyter-notebook and ran Homework 6 from last semester.

This was successful, and worked.
