**Homework 1**

I ran the entirity of Homework 6 from last semester on my Raspberry Pi 4.

To do this, I:

*Put the 64bit OS my SD card.
*Also put a blank ssh file on the SD card.
*Wired ethernet and power to the raspberry pi 4.
*Used ssh pi@raspberrypi.local in a terminal.
*Git cloned the Rasp4 team github, homework 6 from last semester github, as well as the Comp Phys github.
*Downloaded Jupyter - including matlib plot and scripty.
*Downloaded python 3.
*Rebooted as needed.
*Opened up VNC viewer, changing the resolution such that the desktop displayed.
*Opened a jupyter-notebook and ran Homework 6 from last semester.

This was successful, and worked.
