**Homework 1**
In order to get my Raspberry Pi 4 to run the code I did the following:
* Connected directly to the Pi via ethernet connection
* This allowed me to set up a VNC connection to the Pi
* This VNC connection let me get the IP address of the PI once it connected to an arbitrary WiFi network
* Then I was able to enable SSH and and authorize my computer to connect without further use of the VNC
* I downloaded the CompPhys respository and made the code for Assignment 7
* I updated Pillow on my PI for matplotlib to be able to install
* I installed matplotlib and was able to run the code on the pi
