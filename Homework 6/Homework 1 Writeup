**Homework 1**

To run this assignment on a Raspberry Pi 4, the following steps were taken:

*The Raspbian 64 bit OS was installed on a micro SD card.

*Connected the raspi 4 to an ethernet and power supply.

*Enabled SSH and connected a computer to the device.

*Checked to verify that Python3, pip, and other packages (matplotlib, numpy, etc.) were installed with the OS.

*Installed Jupyter Notebook.

*Opened Homework 6, fixed a few errors I made in the assignment last semester, and ran Jupyter Notebook.

*Verified that all these steps also work localy (non-remotely) by connecting the raspi to an external monitor and other peripherals, and ran the notebook again.
